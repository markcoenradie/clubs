## How-To-Update or How-To-Add More Clubs (& Stadiums)

Add more clubs to the .txt datasets. For new clubs add a new line and for new club name variants add a variant using `|`. See the many examples in the .txt datesets :-).

Note: You do NOT need to update / change all the READMEs - these "summaries" get auto-generated from the .txt datasets (from time-to-time with a build script).
